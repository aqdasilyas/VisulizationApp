# VisulizationApp

## NOTE

# weather data is not available is that the "darkSkyApiKey" is not present in the data source. You did not set the "darkSkyApiKey = process.env.DARKSKY_API_KEY" in your backend. However, I have implemented deep linking, which allows the app to navigate to the Weather screen.
